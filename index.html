		    				What do you picture when you think of a <strong>drone?</strong> A solitary, remote-controlled toy with 
		    				propellers, or perhaps a large, unmanned military aircraft? Soon, those images could be quite different: drones are becoming smaller, cheaper to make, can zoom around on their own, and gather in groups of hundreds, even thousands, to fly like a flock of birds.
	    				</p>
	    				<p>
							They’re called <strong>swarms</strong> – get enough of them together, and they could outpace humans in many 
							ways; they could save your life, or they could be a deadly collaborative force on the battlefield.
						</p>
						<h4>Why do drone swarms matter?</h4>
						<p>
			    			For starters, on the battlefield they could outperform weapons and technology that militaries have used for decades. Think about it: in a congested city, teams of tiny quadrotors could buzz around to gather intelligence. Tank battalions could be overrun by miniature attack drones diving in from all directions at once. At sea, thousands of small drones could sweep in to attack a warship; many might be shot down, but others might make it through, destroying radar and leaving the ship defenceless.
			    		</p>
			    		<p>
			    			Plus there is no leader or commander in a swarm; the swarm is a <strong>self-organising system in which all the elements are equal</strong>. Swarming allows drones to search an area efficiently, or fly together without colliding. And only one operator is needed to control the whole swarm.
			    		</p>
			    		<p>
							Swarms are <strong>tough</strong>. One missile can bring down an aircraft, but a swarm can lose dozens of members and keep going. Air defences with a limited supply of missiles can be overwhelmed by enough opponents.
						</p>
						<p>
							But drones will soon be swarming in many other situations too, from rock concerts to barnyards.
